Name: Vigilance

In the modern era of the abundance of data collection, many people are growing more concerned with privacy and safety of what they do. Individuals are concerned of whether big data companies, such as Facebook and Google, are tracking and doing surveillance without our knowledge. Vigilance explores the concept of surveillance, where when you try to retrieve anything, there are always eyes watching behind the walls, monitoring your motion. The goal of the interactor is to grab the treasure from the stand without being caught by the guard.

Technically, there is an ultrasonic sensor that is installed behind the walls, and if there is nobody standing in front of it, the alert light would show green, signaling that there is no one trying to retrieve the treasure and the guard would idly survey the room. If an individual were to come close to the treasure, the guard would turn to look at what the person wants to do, shinning a yellow light, indicating that there is someone there, and may want to attempt to retrieve the treasure. If the person reaches in, a red light blinks and the guard is triggered.

## Motivations
In Greg Orwell’s 1984, citizen were being monitored twenty-four seven, in which nobody is allowed to have any moment of privacy. That dystopian kind of society motivated me because sensors, in a way, are monitoring the environment around them. Therefore, I wanted to create something that utilizes that aspect of sensors. Moreover, there are spies that manage to do their work without being caught on tape. I wanted to simulate that experience, by letting the interactor try to get around the security in order to retrieve an object inside the box.

The implementation of the technicalities of Vigilance is inspired by the Paper Art Interactive made by Ctrl T. The interactive concept that they have is that the flowers would bloom when a person walks close by to it, perhaps using a motor to spin it open. Therefore I wanted to make something that is triggered by proximity, spinning around the guard when someone walks pass it. If the guard catches the person’s attention, they might chose to interact with the object.

Name: Hidden Box in the Forest

As you go into the forest, you see a magical house nearby. It greats you with welcoming, cheerful music as you approach. There is a strange red glow in one of the houses. You think that there is hidden treasure inside and try to pull open the house of the door to see whats inside, but you’ve poked too far, the music switches to a terrible slow sound and the lights close. The work expresses what would happen is one were to get too close or involved in something that that know nothing about.

The technical aspect is that the distance is measured and the interactor gets close to the object, the object starts operating and plays a tune in a normal pitch. If the interactor opens the door to the secret however, the same tune is slowed down and its pitch is lowered so it sounds more creepy and only the red light shines. When the interactor leaves, the clock closes and lights shut off.

## Motivations
Innovation is a result of curiosity and creativity. However, the extreme of anything almost always result in terrible consequences. There is an old saying called “Curiosity Kills the Cat” that many have heard of, which means that do not go around in other’s businesses or else you might get into trouble. This piece expresses how things would go downhill if you get too involved to something you don’t understand. 

Secondly, I based the the technicalities off of a grandfather cuckoo clock, but changed the clock into a hidden compartment instead to make it seem like a box, like the widely known “Pandora’s Box” which is a box that releases horrible spirits if one were to open it, and then combined with sound of the cuckoo clock to catch one’s attention.
